## Overview

All standard motion classes in MotionMachine conform to the `Moveable` protocol. This protocol defines the minimum ways that a motion class should operate within the MotionMachine ecosystem. For instance, each class has start, stop, pause, and resume methods, and each one must support the ability to reverse the direction of the value's movement. This enables them to work seamlessly together without knowing or caring about their specific class types. If you want to use your own custom motion classes within the MotionMachine ecosystem, simply have them adopt the `Moveable` protocol. However, the base `Motion` class offers such modularity that in most cases you can just add to or replace the components you need with your own implementation.

`Motion` and `PhysicsMotion` are the base motion classes; they take in `PropertyData` structs and use these as instructions for how to modify object values. Each instance of `PropertyData` provides movement data that is specific to one property or discrete object. These property values are accessed and set by `ValueAssistant` objects. MotionMachine has assistants for several standard Core Graphics and UIKit value types, but you can add your own value assistants to a `Motion` to increase the types it can use.

These value updates are made as the motion moves through time. This movement is done via the `TempoDriven` protocol, which specifies how `Tempo` classes send update "beats" to motion classes. MotionMachine comes with two such `Tempo` classes  â€“ `CATempo`, which is driven by a `CADisplayLink` object and provides display-refresh syncing as Core Animation does, and `TimerTempo`, which provides tempo updates via an internal `NSTimer` object. The default `TempoDriven` object assigned to all MotionMachine classes is `CATempo`.

## Motion

`Motion` uses a keyPath (i.e. "frame.origin.x") in conjunction with NSObject's KVC to target specific properties of an object and transform their values over a period of time via an easing equation. The keyPath is relative to the parent object passed in, and normally you'd want to pass in the parent object of the object you actually want to modify (i.e. passing in a UIView object if you wish to modify its frame). This is necessary for MotionMachine to be able to modify the original object. However, you may pass in a target object directly for MotionMachine to modify, but that object will only be modified internally. In such cases you may access the object through the Motion's `PropertyData` objects, which are accessible from the `properties` property.

Here's a basic example using this workhorse of MotionMachine. We've supplied the `Motion` with a single `PropertyData` object which defines a property keyPath and an ending value, along with a duration of 1 second and a Quadratic easing equation. This easing parameter defines the easing equation assigned to the `easing` property. If your `Motion` is `reversing`, you can also specify a separate easing equation for the reverse movement via the `reverseEasing` property. If that property is undefined, the `Motion` will use the `easing` property for both motion directions.

Notice that we're directly modifying the x value of the CGPoint inside the UIView's frame. MotionMachine handles these struct modifications transparently for you. Also of note is that the `start()` method can be chained to the constructor, as can `afterDelay(amount:)` which sets a delay before the start of the motion.
```swift
let motion = Motion(target: view,
                properties: [PropertyData(path: "frame.origin.x", start: 20.0, end: 200.0)],
                  duration: 1.0,
                    easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()
                   ).start()
```


Here's a really convenient way to animate complex objects. With the statesForProperties convenience initializer we can add  `PropertyStates` objects to easily animate multiple properties by passing in representations of their start and end states for each animation. MotionMachine will take care of the rest. In the case of the frame being animated, the `Motion` initializer will setup animations for the x, width, and height properties because those values change between the two state presentations we've passed in with the `PropertyStates` object.

Notice that we're setting the UIView's `backgroundColor` and the end of the keypath is `blue`. But UIColor doesn't have an accessible `blue` property, you say? True, but `Motion` has a `UIColorAssistant` which understands this syntactic shorthand and knows to update the `blue` component of the UIColor. You can use this path structure for any of UIColor's value components. MotionMachine comes with many value assistants by default which provide similar shortcuts to Foundation objects, and you can extend this functionality with your own assistants.

Also notice that we only have an ending value for the UIView's `PropertyStates` object for its backgroundColor. If you don't provide a start parameter for a `PropertyStaes` or a `PropertyData` object, `Motion` will use the target object's current value of the property specified in the keyPath as a starting value.
```swift
let motion = Motion(target: view,
       statesForProperties: [PropertyStates(path: "frame", start: CGRect(x: 20.0, y: 50.0, width: 50.0, height: 50.0), end: CGRect(x: 50.0, y: 50.0, width: 200.0, height: 200.0)), PropertyStates(path: "backgroundColor.blue", end: 0.5)],
                  duration: 1.0,
                    easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()
                   ).start()
```


That's fairly compact, but by using the `finalState:` init parameter we can supply objects that represent the final state. `Motion` will use these state objects to create `PropertyData` objects for values that are different than the object's current state. This example provides the final state of a UIView's frame. You could also for instance provide a UIColor object for the UIView's backgroundColor, or both the CGRect and the UIColor! For complex animations this can be a timesaver and a bit more compact.
```swift
let motion = Motion(target: view,
                finalState: ["frame" : CGRectMake(50.0, 0.0, 200.0, 100.0)],
                  duration: 1.0,
                    easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()
                   ).start()
```


To create more complex movements you can set other behaviors in the `options:` init parameter by using one or more `MotionOptions` value. For example, you can set a `Motion` to repeat its motion cycle, to reverse the direction of the value's movement, or both at the same time. A *motion cycle* is one cycle of a `Motion`'s specified value movements. For a normal motion, that will be a movement from the starting values to the ending values. For a reversing motion, a motion cycle comprises both the forward movement and the reverse movement. Thus, a `Motion` that is both reversing and repeating will repeat its motion after moving forwards and then returning back to its starting values.

Note that if you don't set a value to `repeatCycles`, the `Motion` will repeat infinitely.
```swift
let motion = Motion(target: view,
                properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0)],
                  duration: 1.0,
                    easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut(),
                   options: [.reverses, .repeats])
motion.repeatCycles = 1
motion.start()
```


An alternate and more succinct way to set up a repeating `Motion` is to use the chained method `repeats(numberOfCycles:)`. We'll also add the chained method `.reverses(withEasing:)` to tell the `Motion` to reverse and give it a separate easing equation when reversing. Note that you don't need to pass in the `repeats` and `reverses` init options when using these methods, so we omitted that parameter.
```swift
let motion = Motion(target: view,
                properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0)],
                  duration: 1.0,
                    easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())
.repeats(1)
.reverses(withEasing: EasingCubic.easeIn())
.start()
```


#### Easing Equations

MotionMachine includes all the standard Robert Penner easing equations, which are available to `Motion`. All of the easing types have `easeIn()`, `easeOut()`, and `easeInOut()` methods, except for `EasingLinear` which only has `easeNone()`. Of course you can also use your own custom easing equations with `Motion` by conforming to the `EasingUpdateClosure` type.

* EasingLinear (the default equation used if none is specified)
* EasingCubic
* EasingQuadratic
* EasingQuartic
* EasingQuintic
* EasingCubic
* EasingExpo
* EasingSine
* EasingCircular
* EasingElastic
* EasingBounce
* EasingBack


## PhysicsMotion

`PhysicsMotion` uses a keyPath (i.e. "frame.origin.x") to target specific properties of an object and transform their values, using a physics system to update values with decaying velocity. The physics system conforms to the `PhysicsSolving` protocol, and though `PhysicsMotion` uses the (very basic) `PhysicsSystem` class by default you can replace it with your own custom `PhysicsSolving` system.

Here's a simple example. We pass in an initial `velocity`, along with a `friction` value which reduces the velocity over time. The `friction` value should be within a range of 0.0 to 1.0, but there is no limitation on the `velocity` value due to the differing magnitudes of property values you may want to alter. Note that the only necessary `PropertyData` parameter is `path:`; we can't guarantee a certain ending value, so the physics system will determine the value's resting place. (You can still specify a `start:` value though!) Likewise, there is also no duration property because the total movement time is determined by the `velocity` and `friction` interaction.
```swift
let motion = PhysicsMotion(target: view,
                       properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.y")],
                         velocity: 600.0,
                         friction: 0.8
                          ).start()
```

`PhysicsMotion` also supports simple collision handling. In this example we're going to turn on collision detection and add a `restitution` value. This value enables the object to collide and "bounce" off a `PropertyData`'s `start` and `end` values. The `restitution` value determines the elasticity of a colliding object, which in effect determines how much velocity the property values retain after colliding with an edge. A `restitution` value of 0.0 results in no bouncing at all, while a value of 1.0 results in no energy being lost in the collision.
```swift
let config = PhysicsConfiguration(velocity: 300, friction: 0.72, restitution: 0.5, useCollisionDetection: true)
motion = PhysicsMotion(target: view,
                   properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", end: 300)],
                configuration: config)
.start()
```

Although `PhysicsMotion` uses a physics simulation instead of specifying discrete ending values, we can still apply `repeats` and `reverses` options, and `PhysicsMotion` has the same chainable `repeats()` method. Repeating and reversing act in the same way as `Motion` and interacts with `MoveableCollection` classes as you would expect.
```swift
let motion = PhysicsMotion(target: view,
                       properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x")],
                         velocity: 150.0,
                         friction: 0.75,
                          options: [.reverses])
.repeats(1).start()
```

## PathMotion

`PathMotion` transforms a `CGPoint` along a `CGPath` object over a period of time via an easing equation. Unlike a normal `Motion` class it does not accept `PropertyData` objects; due to the complex nature of paths, `PathMotion` only accepts a `PathState` object, an easing equation, and optional starting and end points to determine what area of the path to animate along. The resulting transformed `CGPoint` value is provided via its status closure methods. Thus a typical use would be to listen to the `updated({ (motion, currentPoint)` closure and use the provided `currentPoint` parameter to update your UIView's `center` property. Though it is more limited in what values it transforms and it does not support `additive` motion at this time, in all other respects `PathMotion` integrates with the `Moveable` ecosystem just like the other motion types, greatly expanding the types of complex animations MotionMachine can create. 

![PathMotion spiral animation](path_spiral.gif)

Here's a basic example. We've supplied the `PathMotion` with a basic CGPath via a `PathState` object, an easing equation, and we've told it to reverse back to the beginning once it travels to the end. Notice though how we've defined a `startPosition` and `endPosition`. This tells the `PathMotion` it should start the animation at a point 10% from the beginning of the path and end the animation at a point 80% along the path's length. If you leave these parameters out it will travel the full distance.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(rect: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
motion = PathMotion(path: path.cgPath,
                duration: 1.0,
           startPosition: 0.1,
             endPosition: 0.8,
                  easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut(),
                 options: [.reverses])
motion.start()
```

In this example note that we've added an `edgeBehavior` parameter to the `PathMotion` initializer. There are two types of edge behaviors â€“ `stopAtEdges` (the default), which simply stops motion once the animated point gets to either specified edge point, and `contiguousEdges`, which tells the `PathMotion` that the path's starting and ending edges should be treated as connected, contiguous points. If the animated point travels beyond the path's edge, as can happen with some easing equation classes like `EasingElastic` and `EasingBack`, the motion will continue in the current direction at the beginning of the other edge. This behavior type is useful with closed paths like polygonal shapes to create a seamless animation.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(rect: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
motion = PathMotion(path: path.cgPath,
                duration: 1.0,
                  easing: EasingElastic.easeInOut(),
            edgeBehavior: .contiguousEdges)
.repeats()  
.start()
```

The `startPosition` and `endPosition` values can also be flipped. Doing so will make the point travel along the path from the end of the path towards the beginning in its forward motion. In this example, the motion point will start at 80% along the path and travel "backwards" to 20%. If you added a `reverses` option, then at the end of the motion it would reverse along the path back to 80%.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(rect: CGRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: 100, height: 100))
motion = PathMotion(path: path.cgPath,
                duration: 1.0,
           startPosition: 0.8,
             endPosition: 0.2,
                  easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())
motion.start()
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Note that because it is mathematically complex to find all points on a CGPath, large, complex paths can present performance challenges for `PathMotion` to animate along. Fortunately, `PathMotion` comes with a performance mode. When this mode is activated, `PathState` generates a lookup table which it uses to find points on the path in O(n) time. While this increases setup time, it significantly improves performance while the motion is running, for instance from 10% down to 1% CPU usage. To use performance mode, call the async method `setupPerformanceMode()` before starting the `PathMotion`, as shown in the below example. This method will run the lookup table generation code on a background queue and return when complete. For most reasonably large paths this should take under a second.
```swift
Task {
    await motion?.setupPerformanceMode()
    motion?.start()
}
```

## PathPhysicsMotion

`PathPhysicsMotion` transforms a `CGPoint` along a `CGPath` object using a physics system to update the point's position with decaying velocity. Like `PathMotion` it does not accept `PropertyData` objects; due to the complex nature of paths, `PathPhysicsMotion` only accepts a `PathState` object and optional starting and end points to determine what area of the path to animate along. The resulting transformed `CGPoint` value is provided via its status closure methods. Thus a typical use would be to listen to the `updated({ (motion, currentPoint)` closure and use the provided `currentPoint` parameter to update your UIView's `center` property. Though it is more limited in what values it transforms and it does not support `additive` motion at this time, in all other respects `PathPhysicsMotion` integrates with the `Moveable` ecosystem just like the other motion types, greatly expanding the types of complex animations MotionMachine can create. 

Here's a basic example. We've supplied the `PathPhysicsMotion` with a basic CGPath via a `PathState` object, an easing equation, and we've told it to reverse back to the beginning once it travels to the end. Notice though how we've defined a `startPosition` and `endPosition`. This tells the `PathPhysicsMotion` it should start the animation at a point 10% from the beginning of the path and end the animation at a point 80% along the path's length. If you leave these parameters out it will have the full length of the path to travel along.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(arcCenter: CGPoint(x: 20, y: 20), radius: 100, startAngle: 0.087, endAngle: 1.66, clockwise: true)
let config = PhysicsConfiguration(velocity: 500, friction: 0.4)
motion = PathPhysicsMotion(path: path.cgPath, 
                  configuration: config,
                  startPosition: 0.1, 
                    endPosition: 0.8)
motion.start()
```

In this second example we're going to turn on collision detection and add a `restitution` value. Technically, collisions are turned on any time the `stopAtEdges` edge behavior is chosen, but adding a `restitution` value will cause a change in the motion. This value enables the object to collide and "bounce" off the starting and ending points when a point reaches them. The `restitution` value determines the elasticity of the object, which in effect determines how much velocity the object retains after colliding with an edge. A `restitution` value of 0.0 (the default if no value is provided) results in no bouncing at all, while a value of 1.0 results in no energy being lost in the collision. By default the collision points are at the start and end of the path, but if you specify your own start and end points those will be used instead.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(arcCenter: CGPoint(x: 20, y: 20), radius: 100, startAngle: 0.087, endAngle: 1.66, clockwise: true)
let config = PhysicsConfiguration(velocity: 600, friction: 0.4, restitution: 0.8)
motion = PathPhysicsMotion(path: path.cgPath, 
                  configuration: config)
motion.start()
```

Although `PathPhysicsMotion` uses a physics simulation instead of specifying discrete ending values, we can still apply `repeats` and `reverses` options. Repeating and reversing act in the same way as `Motion` and interacts with `MoveableCollection` classes as you would expect.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(arcCenter: CGPoint(x: 20, y: 20), radius: 100, startAngle: 0.087, endAngle: 1.66, clockwise: true)
let config = PhysicsConfiguration(velocity: 500, friction: 0.4)
motion = PathPhysicsMotion(path: path.cgPath, 
                  configuration: config)
.reverses()
.repeats(1)
.start()
```

The `startPosition` and `endPosition` values can also be flipped. Doing so will make the point travel along the path from the end of the path towards the beginning in its forward motion. Be aware that if you do this, the velocity should also be a negative value in order for the point to travel in the correct direction. In this example, the motion point will start at 80% along the path and travel "backwards" to 20%.
```swift
let path = UIBezierPath(arcCenter: CGPoint(x: 20, y: 20), radius: 100, startAngle: 0.087, endAngle: 1.66, clockwise: true)
let config = PhysicsConfiguration(velocity: -600, friction: 0.4, restitution: 0.8)
motion = PathPhysicsMotion(path: path.cgPath, 
                  configuration: config,
                  startPosition: 0.8, 
                    endPosition: 0.2)
motion.start()
```

    await motion?.setupPerformanceMode()
    motion?.start()
}
```

## MotionGroup

`MotionGroup` is a `MoveableCollection` class that manages a group of `Moveable` objects, controlling their movements in parallel. It's handy for controlling and synchronizing multiple `Moveable` objects. `MotionGroup` can hold `Motion` objects and even other `MoveableCollection` objects. As with all `Moveable` classes, you can `pause()` and `resume()` a `MotionGroup`, which pauses and resumes all of its child motions simultaneously.

This example adds two `Motion` objects and starts them.
```swift
let motion1 = Motion(view1, property: PropertyData("frame.origin.y", 200.0), duration: 1.0, easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())
let motion2 = Motion(view2, property: PropertyData("frame.origin.y", 200.0), duration: 1.0, easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())

let group = MotionGroup(motions: [motion1, motion2]).start()
```


If you don't need to do anything individually with the child objects of a `MotionGroup`, you can just instantiate them directly; the `MotionGroup` will keep a reference to all objects it manages. In this example we're creating `Motion` objects within the `add(motion:)` method, which is chainable with the constructor.

Note that we've added a `reverses(syncsChildMotions:)` method to the init chain, which tells the `MotionGroup` to set all of its child motions to reverse. Passing `true` to the `syncsChildMotions:` parameter specifies that the `MotionGroup` should synchronize its child motions before reversing their movement direction. That is, the `Motion` with the `duration` of 1.0 will wait until the `Motion` with a 1.2 second duration has finished its forward movement. Only then will both reverse directions and move back to their starting values.
```swift
let group = MotionGroup()
.add(Motion(target: square1,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0)],
          duration: 1.0,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))
.add(Motion(target: square2,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.size.width", 60.0)],
          duration: 1.2,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))
.reverses(syncsChildMotions: true)
.start()

```


`Motion` objects have just been used so far to populate each `MotionGroup`, but any `Moveable` class can be added. In this example we're adding a `Motion` and another `MotionGroup` to a different `MotionGroup` which is set to reverse. Reversing and repeating options work as expected with child groups. You can build up very complex motions by nesting groups like this, as many levels deep as you need.
```swift
let subgroup = MotionGroup()
.add(Motion(target: square1,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0)],
          duration: 1.0,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))
.add(Motion(target: square2,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.y", 60.0)],
          duration: 1.2,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))

let group2 = MotionGroup(options: [.reverses])
.add(subgroup)
.add(Motion(target: square2,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.size.width", 150.0)],
          duration: 2.0,
            easing: EasingSine.easeInOut()))
.start()
```


## MotionSequence

`MotionSequence` is a `MoveableCollection` class which moves a collection of `Moveable` objects in sequential order. `MotionSequence` provides a powerful and easy way of chaining together individual motions to create complex animations. `MotionSequence` can hold `Motion` objects and even other `MoveableCollection` objects. The order of its `steps` Array property is the order in which the sequence steps are triggered.

A simple example that adds two `Motion` objects. The `start()` method chained to the `MotionSequence` constructor will start the sequence, with motion1 starting its movement first, and then motion2 starting after the first `Motion` completes.
```swift
let motion1 = Motion(view, property: PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0), duration: 1.0, easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())
let motion2 = Motion(view, property: PropertyData("frame.origin.y", 300.0), duration: 1.0, easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())

let sequence = MotionSequence(steps: [motion1, motion2]).start()
```


As with `MotionGroup`, if you don't need to do anything individually the child objects of a `MotionSequence`, you can instantiate them directly; the `MotionSequence` will keep a reference to all objects it manages. In this example we're creating `Motion` objects with the `add(motion:)` method, which is chainable with the constructor. These motions will be triggered in the order they are added.
```swift
let sequence = MotionSequence(options: [.reverses])
.add(Motion(target: square,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0)],
          duration: 1.0,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))
.add(Motion(target: square,
        properties: [PropertyData("frame.size.width", 60.0)],
          duration: 1.2,
            easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut()))
.start()
```


One of the most powerful aspects of `MotionSequence` is the ability for it to coordinate the movements of its child motions when it is reversing. This is set with the `reversingMode` property, or by passing a `CollectionReversingMode` value into the chainable `.reverses(_:)` method as shown in the example below. When in `sequential` mode, all of its sequence steps will move in a forward direction when the `MotionSequence` is reversing direction. That is, when reversing the `MotionSequence` will signal each of its `Moveable` steps to move normally, just in a reversed order. This mode is useful if for example you have a series of lights that should blink on and off in sequential order, and the only thing that should change is the order in which they blink. But the `contiguous` mode is where things get interesting. When in this mode and the `MotionSequence` is moving in the reverse direction, the values of each sequence step will move in reverse, and in reverse order, thus giving the effect that the whole sequence is fluidly moving in reverse. This is a really powerful way of making many separate animations appear to be a single animation when reversing.

In the below example, four circles are set up to animate their topAnchor constraints and then reverse. Each of these `MotionGroup` objects is then added to a `MotionSequence` which also reverses, with its `reversingMode` set to `sequential` in order to have each circle motion play and reverse independently and serially.

```swift

// create a reversing MotionSequence with its reversingMode set to sequential to have each child motion play independently.
sequence = MotionSequence().reverses(.sequential)

// set up motions for each circle and add them to the MotionSequence
for x in 0..<4 {
    // motion to animate a topAnchor constraint down
    let down = Motion(target: constraints["y\(x)"]!,
                      properties: [PropertyData("constant", 60.0)],
                      duration: 0.4,
                      easing: EasingQuartic.easeInOut())

    // motion to change background color of circle
    let color = Motion(target: circles[x],
                       statesForProperties: [PropertyStates(path: "backgroundColor", end: UIColor.init(red: 91.0/255.0, green:189.0/255.0, blue:231.0/255.0, alpha:1.0))],
                       duration: 0.3,
                       easing: EasingQuadratic.easeInOut())

    // wrap the Motions in a MotionGroup and set it to reverse
    let group = MotionGroup(motions: [down, color]).reverses(syncsChildMotions: true)

    // add group to the MotionSequence
    sequence.add(group)
}
sequence.start()
```

Here is the same `MotionSequence` with its `reversingMode` set to `contiguous`. You can see how each child motion waits after its forward motion, and then plays their reverse motion in reverse sequence.

```swift

// create a reversing MotionSequence with its reversingMode set to contiguous to create a single fluid motion from its child motions
sequence = MotionSequence().reverses(.contiguous)
```

## Status Updates

MotionMachine has a full compliment of status callback closures. They are chainable with the constructor. All of the following closures are available with the standard `Moveable` classes.

```swift
let motion = Motion(square, duration: 2.0, property: PropertyData("frame.origin.x", 200.0))
.started({ (motion) in
    // Called when a motion starts.
})
.stopped({ (motion) in
    // Called when the stop() method is called on a Moveable object.
})
.updated({ (motion) in
    // Called when the update(withTimeInterval:) method is called while a Moveable object is currently moving.
})
.reversed({ (motion) in
    // Called when the Moveable object reverses its movement direction.
})
.repeated({ (motion) in
    // Called when the Moveable object repeats its motion cycle.
})
.paused({ (motion) in
    // Called when the pause() method is called on a Moveable object.
})
.resumed({ (motion) in
    // Called when the resume() method is called on a Moveable object.
})
.completed({ (motion) in
    // Called when a Moveable object's motion operation has fully completed.
})
```


## Supported Value Types

`Motion` and `PhysicsMotion` use classes that conform to the `ValueAssistant` protocol to retrieve and update property values. Several assistants for common Quartz and UIKit framework value types are included in MotionMachine. These assistants provide direct keypath access to struct properties that wouldn't be directly accessible, such as the `width` property of a CGSize struct. You can also add your own custom assistants to extend the types that `Motion` and `PhysicsMotion` can work with.

The following `ValueAssistant` classes are included in MotionMachine:

*CGStructAssistant*
* CGPoint
* CGSize
* CGRect
* CGVector
* CGAffineTransform
* CATransform3D

*UIColorAssistant*
* UIColor (individual color properties can be accessed using these shortcuts)
  - red, green, blue, hue, saturation, brightness, alpha, white

*CIColorAssistant*
* CIColor (individual color properties can be accessed using these shortcuts)
  - red, green, blue, alpha

*UIKitStructAssistant*
* UIEdgeInsets
* UIOffset
