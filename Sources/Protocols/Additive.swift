    /**
     *  A Boolean which determines whether this motion object should change its object values additively. Additive animation allows multiple motions to produce a compound effect, creating smooth transitions and blends between different ending value targets. Additive animation has been the default behavior for UIKit animations since iOS 8 and is great for making user interface animations fluid and responsive. MotionMachine uses its own implementation of additive movement, so you can use additive motions on any supported object properties.
     *
     *   By default, each Additive object should apply a strong influence on the movement of a property towards its ending value. This means that two Additive objects with the same duration and moving the same object property to different ending values will fight, and the "winning" value will be the last Additive object to start its movement. If the durations or starting times are different, a transition between the values will occur. If you wish to create additive motions that apply weighted value updates, you can adjust the ``additiveWeighting`` property. Setting values to that property that are less than 1.0 will create compound additive motions that are blends of each motion object's ending values.

     *  A weighting between 0.0 and 1.0 which is applied to this Motion's object value updates when it is using an additive movement. The higher the weighting amount, the more its additive updates apply to the properties being moved. A value of 1.0 will mean the motion will reach the specific `end` value of each ``PropertyData`` being moved, while a value of 0.0 will not move towards the `end` value at all. When multiple motions participating in additive motion are moving the same object properties, adjusting this weighting on each Motion can create complex composite motions.
