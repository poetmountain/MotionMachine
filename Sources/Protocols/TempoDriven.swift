 *  This protocol represents objects that subscribe to a ``TempoProviding`` object's update beats. Every movement of a value occurs because time has changed. These beats drive the motion, sending timestamps by which delta values can be calculated. All standard MotionMachine motion classes conform to this protocol.

 *  - important: While you aren't required to implement this protocol in order to update your own custom ``Moveable`` classes, it is the preferred way to interact with the MotionMachine ecosystem unless your requirements prevent using ``TempoProviding`` objects for updating your value interpolations.
