/**
 *  This protocol represents objects that subscribe to a ``TempoProviding`` object's update beats. Every movement of a value occurs because time has changed. These beats drive the motion, sending timestamps by which delta values can be calculated. All standard MotionMachine motion classes conform to this protocol.
 *
 *  - important: While you aren't required to implement this protocol in order to update your own custom ``Moveable`` classes, it is the preferred way to interact with the MotionMachine ecosystem unless your requirements prevent using ``TempoProviding`` objects for updating your value interpolations.

     *  - Note: By default, this class will assign an instance of ``DisplayLinkTempo`` to this property, which automatically chooses the best tempo class for the system platform. For iOS, visionOS, and tvOS the class chosen is ``CATempo``, but for macOS it is ``MacDisplayLinkTempo``. Both classes internally use a `CADisplayLink` object for updates. For watchOS and non-Apple platforms, ``TimerTempo`` is chosen as `CADisplayLink` is not available.
