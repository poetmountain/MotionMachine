 *  `Tempo` is an abstract class that provides a basic structure for sending update beats. `Moveable` classes use these beats to calculate new motion interpolation values. Concrete subclasses should call `tempoBeatUpdate` with incremental timestamps as necessary.
 
    - warning: This class should not be instantiated directly, as it provides no updates on its own.
