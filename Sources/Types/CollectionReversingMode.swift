For example, this mode would be chosen if you have a series of lights that should blink on and off in sequential order, and the only thing that should change is the order in which they blink.

     *  Specifies that when the sequence's ``motionDirection`` property is `reverse`, all ``Moveable`` sequence steps will move in a reverse direction to their normal motion. That is, the values of each sequence step will move in reverse, and in reverse order, thus giving the effect that the whole sequence is fluidly moving in reverse. Additionally, when the sequence's ``motionDirection`` is `forward`, each sequence step will pause after completing their forward movement.
     *
     *  - remark: This mode is useful if you want to create a sequence whose sequence steps reverse in a mirror image of their forward motion. This is a really powerful way of making many separate animations appear to be a single, fluid animation when reversing.
