/// This struct represents the states of a single object to be used in a motion operation, used to create ``PropertyData`` objects for each object property. Because the ``start`` and ``end`` properties can represent any value type, it is used by ``ValueAssistant`` classes to internally generate ``PropertyData`` objects for each property value of the object. As such, it is a convenient way to set up many property value interpolations for an object by simply passing in representations of that object at its starting and ending points.
///
/// > Note: These state values must be of the same object type as the property located at the `keyPath`. For instance, if the ``keyPath`` property points to a CGRect object, you must provide CGRect objects for the ``start`` and ``end`` properties.

    /// > Note: Depending on the state object being used for property generation, multiple ``PropertyData`` objects may result, such as the x and y properties of CGPoint. ``ValueAssistant`` classes make a best attempt at ignoring the generation of properties whose values do not change between the starting and ending states.
