    /**
     *  A Boolean which determines whether this Motion should change its object values additively. Additive animation allows multiple motions to produce a compound effect, creating smooth transitions and blends between different ending value targets. Additive animation is the default behavior for UIKit animations as of iOS 8 and is great for making user interface animations fluid and responsive. MotionMachine uses its own implementation of additive movement, so you can use additive motions on any supported object properties.
     *
     *   By default, each Motion will apply a strong influence on the movement of a property towards its ending value. This means that two Motion objects with the same duration and moving the same object property to different ending values will fight, and the "winning" value will be the last Motion to start its movement. If the durations or starting times are different, a transition between the values will occur. This transition occurs because the most recent additive Motion will assign the ending value of the last additive Motion as its starting position. If you wish to create additive motions that apply weighted value updates, you can adjust the `additiveWeighting` property. Setting values to that property that are less than 1.0 will create composite additive motions that are blends of each Motion object's ending values.
     *
     *  - remark: The `start` value of `PropertyData` objects are ignored for additive animations, and will instead combine with the current value of the properties being moved.
     *
     *  - warning: Please be aware that because of the composite nature of additive movements, values can temporarily move past a `PropertyData`'s specified `end` value. This can have unintended consequences if the property value you are moving is clamped to a limited range. Also note that additive movements may not work well with compound motions that are comprised of sequences, reversing, or repeating, and will not behave correctly when other Motion objects moving the same properties are not using the additive mode. Because of these caveats, the default value is `false`.
